# Claude Code Guidelines by Sabrina Ramonov

## Implementation Best Practices

### 0 — Purpose  

These rules ensure maintainability, safety, and developer velocity. 
**MUST** rules are enforced by CI; **SHOULD** rules are strongly recommended.

---

### 1 — Before Coding

- **BP-1 (MUST)** Ask the user clarifying questions.
- **BP-2 (SHOULD)** Draft and confirm an approach for complex work.  
- **BP-3 (SHOULD)** If ≥ 2 approaches exist, list clear pros and cons.

---

### 2 — While Coding

- **C-1 (MUST)** Follow TDD: scaffold stub -> write failing test -> implement.
- **C-2 (MUST)** Name functions with existing domain vocabulary for consistency.  
- **C-3 (SHOULD NOT)** Introduce classes when small testable functions suffice.  
- **C-4 (SHOULD)** Prefer simple, composable, testable functions.
- **C-5 (MUST)** Prefer branded `type`s for IDs
  ```ts
  type UserId = Brand<string, 'UserId'>   // ✅ Good
  type UserId = string                    // ❌ Bad
  ```  
- **C-6 (MUST)** Use `import type { … }` for type-only imports.
- **C-7 (SHOULD NOT)** Add comments except for critical caveats; rely on self‑explanatory code.
- **C-8 (SHOULD)** Default to `type`; use `interface` only when more readable or interface merging is required. 
- **C-9 (SHOULD NOT)** Extract a new function unless it will be reused elsewhere, is the only way to unit-test otherwise untestable logic, or drastically improves readability of an opaque block.

---

### 3 — Testing

- **T-1 (MUST)** For a simple function, colocate unit tests in `*.spec.ts` in same directory as source file.
- **T-2 (MUST)** For any API change, add/extend integration tests in `packages/api/test/*.spec.ts`.
- **T-3 (MUST)** ALWAYS separate pure-logic unit tests from DB-touching integration tests.
- **T-4 (SHOULD)** Prefer integration tests over heavy mocking.  
- **T-5 (SHOULD)** Unit-test complex algorithms thoroughly.
- **T-6 (SHOULD)** Test the entire structure in one assertion if possible
  ```ts
  expect(result).toBe([value]) // Good

  expect(result).toHaveLength(1); // Bad
  expect(result[0]).toBe(value); // Bad
  ```

---

### 4 — Database

- **D-1 (MUST)** Type DB helpers as `KyselyDatabase | Transaction<Database>`, so it works for both transactions and DB instances.  
- **D-2 (SHOULD)** Override incorrect generated types in `packages/shared/src/db-types.override.ts`. e.g. autogenerated types show incorrect BigInt value – so we override to `string` manually.

---

### 5 — Code Organization

- **O-1 (MUST)** Place code in `packages/shared` only if used by ≥ 2 packages.

---

### 6 — Tooling Gates

- **G-1 (MUST)** `prettier --check` passes.  
- **G-2 (MUST)** `turbo typecheck lint` passes.  

---

### 7 - Git

- **GH-1 (MUST**) Use Conventional Commits format when writing commit messages: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0
- **GH-2 (SHOULD NOT**) Refer to Claude or Anthropic in commit messages.

---

## Writing Functions Best Practices

When evaluating whether a function you implemented is good or not, use this checklist:

1. Can you read the function and HONESTLY easily follow what it's doing? If yes, then stop here.
2. Does the function have very high cyclomatic complexity? (number of independent paths, or, in a lot of cases, number of nesting if if-else as a proxy). If it does, then it's probably sketchy.
3. Are there any common data structures and algorithms that would make this function much easier to follow and more robust? Parsers, trees, stacks / queues, etc.
4. Are there any unused parameters in the function?
5. Are there any unnecessary type casts that can be moved to function arguments?
6. Is the function easily testable without mocking core features (e.g. sql queries, redis, etc.)? If not, can this function be tested as part of an integration test?
7. Does it have any hidden untested dependencies or any values that can be factored out into the arguments instead? Only care about non-trivial dependencies that can actually change or affect the function.
8. Brainstorm 3 better function names and see if the current name is the best, consistent with rest of codebase.

IMPORTANT: you SHOULD NOT refactor out a separate function unless there is a compelling need, such as:
  - the refactored function is used in more than one place
  - the refactored function is easily unit testable while the original function is not AND you can't test it any other way
  - the original function is extremely hard to follow and you resort to putting comments everywhere just to explain it

## Writing Tests Best Practices

When evaluating whether a test you've implemented is good or not, use this checklist:

1. SHOULD parameterize inputs; never embed unexplained literals such as 42 or "foo" directly in the test.
2. SHOULD NOT add a test unless it can fail for a real defect. Trivial asserts (e.g., expect(2).toBe(2)) are forbidden.
3. SHOULD ensure the test description states exactly what the final expect verifies. If the wording and assert don’t align, rename or rewrite.
4. SHOULD compare results to independent, pre-computed expectations or to properties of the domain, never to the function’s output re-used as the oracle.
5. SHOULD follow the same lint, type-safety, and style rules as prod code (prettier, ESLint, strict types).
6. SHOULD express invariants or axioms (e.g., commutativity, idempotence, round-trip) rather than single hard-coded cases whenever practical. Use `fast-check` library e.g.
```
import fc from 'fast-check';
import { describe, expect, test } from 'vitest';
import { getCharacterCount } from './string';

describe('properties', () => {
  test('concatenation functoriality', () => {
    fc.assert(
      fc.property(
        fc.string(),
        fc.string(),
        (a, b) =>
          getCharacterCount(a + b) ===
          getCharacterCount(a) + getCharacterCount(b)
      )
    );
  });
});
```

7. Unit tests for a function should be grouped under `describe(functionName, () => ...`.
8. Use `expect.any(...)` when testing for parameters that can be anything (e.g. variable ids).
9. ALWAYS use strong assertions over weaker ones e.g. `expect(x).toEqual(1)` instead of `expect(x).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(1)`.
10. SHOULD test edge cases, realistic input, unexpected input, and value boundaries.
11. SHOULD NOT test conditions that are caught by the type checker.

## Code Organization

- `packages/api` - Fastify API server
  - `packages/api/src/publisher/*.ts` - Specific implementations of publishing to social media platforms
- `packages/web` - Next.js 15 app with App Router
- `packages/shared` - Shared types and utilities
  - `packages/shared/social.ts` - Character size and media validations for social media platforms
- `packages/api-schema` - API contract schemas using TypeBox

## Remember Shortcuts

Remember the following shortcuts which the user may invoke at any time.

### QNEW

When I type "qnew", this means:

```
Understand all BEST PRACTICES listed in CLAUDE.md.
Your code SHOULD ALWAYS follow these best practices.
Understand and strictly follow the architecture in CONTEXT.md 
```

### QPLAN
When I type "qplan", this means:
```
Analyze similar parts of the codebase and determine whether your plan:
- is consistent with rest of codebase
- introduces minimal changes
- reuses existing code
```

## QCODE

When I type "qcode", this means:

```
Implement your plan and make sure your new tests pass.
Always run tests to make sure you didn't break anything else.
Always run `prettier` on the newly created files to ensure standard formatting.
Always run `turbo typecheck lint` to make sure type checking and linting passes.
```

### QCHECK

When I type "qcheck", this means:

```
You are a SKEPTICAL senior software engineer.
Perform this analysis for every MAJOR code change you introduced (skip minor changes):

1. CLAUDE.md checklist Writing Functions Best Practices.
2. CLAUDE.md checklist Writing Tests Best Practices.
3. CLAUDE.md checklist Implementation Best Practices.
```

### QCHECKF

When I type "qcheckf", this means:

```
You are a SKEPTICAL senior software engineer.
Perform this analysis for every MAJOR function you added or edited (skip minor changes):

1. CLAUDE.md checklist Writing Functions Best Practices.
```

### QCHECKT

When I type "qcheckt", this means:

```
Add all changes to staging, create a commit, and push to remote.

Follow this checklist for writing your commit message:
- SHOULD use Conventional Commits format: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0
- SHOULD NOT refer to Claude or Anthropic in the commit message.
- SHOULD structure commit message as follows:
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
- commit SHOULD contain the following structural elements to communicate intent: 
fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.
```


## Architecture Overview

This is a modular monolith trading platform with three main runtime processes:

1. **Core Engine (Python)** - `/app/engine/`
   - Single process with async in-memory event bus
   - Modules communicate via pub/sub without network hops
   - Typical latency: ≤700-900ms p95 from candle close → order POST

2. **Order Router (Go)** - `/app/router/`
   - Separate process for safety and idempotency
   - Signs and sends Spot/USD-M REST orders to Binance
   - Handles exchange info, rounding, and order reconciliation

3. **BFF/UI (TypeScript)** - `/app/bff/` and `/app/ui/`
   - NestJS backend serving REST/WebSocket APIs
   - Next.js frontend with Lightweight Charts for visualization

```

## Event Flow and Contracts

The system uses an async event-driven architecture with these key event types:

1. **candles.v1** - Raw OHLCV data from Binance WebSocket
2. **features.v1** - Technical indicators (EMA, RSI, MACD, ATR, BB)
3. **smc_events.v1** - Smart Money Concepts signals (CHOCH, BOS)
4. **zones.v1** - Order blocks and fair value gaps
5. **signals_raw.v1** - Candidate trading signals with entry/SL/TP hints
6. **decision.v1** - Final trading decisions with position sizing
7. **order_update.v1** - Order status updates from router

## Module Responsibilities

### Engine Modules (`/app/engine/`)

- **ingest/** - Binance WebSocket connection, REST backfill, deduplication
- **features/** - Technical indicator calculations, stateless and idempotent
- **smc/** - Smart Money Concepts: pivot detection, structure breaks, zones
- **retest/** - Zone retest analysis with confluence checking
- **regime_vol/** - Market regime classification (trending/ranging/volatile)
- **news_funding_guards/** - Risk guards for news events and funding rates
- **decision/** - Signal fusion, position sizing, risk management
- **paper/** - Paper trading with slippage simulation
- **backtest/** - Vectorized backtesting with shared math from live modules
- **adapters/** - Database (TimescaleDB), cache (Redis), router client

### Critical Implementation Details

1. **WebSocket Handling**: Only emit candle when `k.x == true` (closed)
2. **Idempotency**: Every order includes unique `newClientOrderId`
3. **Database Keys**: `(venue, symbol, tf, open_time)` for candles
4. **Risk Limits**: 0.5% fixed-fractional per trade, ATR-scaled
5. **Futures**: Max 3× leverage, ReduceOnly TPs, STOP_MARKET SL

## Python Engine Specifics

- Uses FastAPI for health/metrics endpoints
- AsyncIO tasks per (symbol × timeframe) pipeline
- Pydantic models in `types.py` for all events
- In-process async event bus in `bus.py`
- Config via `config.yaml` with environment overrides

## Go Router Specifics

- Separate process for order safety
- Handles both Spot and USD-M Futures APIs
- Strict idempotency and reconciliation
- Exchange info caching for rounding rules

## TypeScript Services

- NestJS BFF provides REST + WebSocket APIs
- Next.js UI uses Lightweight Charts library
- pnpm workspaces for monorepo management
- Shared types between BFF and UI

## Database Schema

TimescaleDB hypertables for time-series data:
- `candles` - OHLCV data with automatic partitioning
- `indicators` - Technical indicator values
- `smc_events` - Structure breaks and change of character
- `zones` - Supply/demand zones and order blocks
- `orders` - Order history with status tracking
- `positions` - Current and historical positions

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for SMC math and indicator calculations
- Golden vector tests for indicator parity
- Contract tests for event schemas
- Load tests for WebSocket fan-in
- Paper trading for strategy validation

## Performance Targets

- Candle close → signals: ≤500ms p95
- Decision → Router POST: ≤300ms p95
- REST backfill after disconnect: <5s
- UI chart redraw: <150ms

## Environment Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
- `BINANCE_API_KEY`, `BINANCE_API_SECRET` (separate for Spot/Futures)
- `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME` for PostgreSQL
- `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT` for cache
- `ROUTER_URL` for engine→router communication
