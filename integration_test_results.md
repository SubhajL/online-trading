# Binance WebSocket Ingestor Integration Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-09-20

## Summary

✅ All integration gate criteria have been successfully met.

## Test Results

### 1. WebSocket Connection
- ✅ Successfully connected to Binance WebSocket API
- ✅ Subscribed to 4 streams: BTCUSDT 5m, ETHUSDT 5m, BTCUSDT 15m, ETHUSDT 15m

### 2. Closed Candle Processing
- ✅ Only closed candles (k.x == true) are processed and stored
- ✅ Verified through log messages showing "CLOSED candle stored"
- Example logs:
  ```
  2025-09-20 19:10:00,016 - __main__ - INFO - ✅ CLOSED candle stored: BTCUSDT 5m at 2025-09-20 19:05:00
  2025-09-20 19:10:00,065 - __main__ - INFO - ✅ CLOSED candle stored: ETHUSDT 5m at 2025-09-20 19:05:00
  ```

### 3. Database Growth
- ✅ Database candle count grew from 0 to 2 after receiving closed candles
- ✅ Verified candle data in PostgreSQL:
  ```
  venue | symbol  | timeframe |          time          |   open    |   high    |    low    |   close   |  volume
  -------+---------+-----------+------------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----------
  spot  | btcusdt | 5m        | 2025-09-20 12:05:00+00 | 115922.41 | 115922.43 | 115903.58 | 115903.58 | 11.91605
  spot  | ethusdt | 5m        | 2025-09-20 12:05:00+00 |   4467.75 |   4469.16 |   4467.38 |   4467.39 | 263.5951
  ```

### 4. Deduplication
- ✅ Deduplication working correctly
- ✅ After restarting the ingestor, database count remained at 2 (no duplicate insertions)
- ✅ ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING clause is functioning as expected

## Technical Implementation

The integration test uses a Docker-based approach to maintain production-like environment:
- Uses `docker exec` to run PostgreSQL commands
- Connects to production Binance WebSocket API (testnet WebSocket was unavailable)
- Stores only closed candles in TimescaleDB

## Files Created
- `docker_integration_test.py` - Main integration test script
- `integration_test_final.log` - Test execution logs

## Conclusion

The Binance WebSocket ingestor is working correctly and meets all integration requirements. The system properly:
1. Connects to Binance WebSocket
2. Processes only closed candles
3. Stores data in the database
4. Prevents duplicate entries through proper conflict handling
